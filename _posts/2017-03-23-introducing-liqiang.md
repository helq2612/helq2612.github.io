As a Master of Science student majored in Computer Science in Oregon State University, I have a significant background in machine learning and data science, details see [about](https://helq2612.github.io/about/).

There are many points that make me special to other CS students. For example,I have two master degrees in Mechanical Enginnering, one in Structure Viberation, the other one in Thermal and Fluid Science. You might ask: WoW, triple MS! But why don't go to find a job in Mechanical Engineering? OK, it's a hard question to answer, and the story behind it might take you 10 hours. But, the key reason is that I like coding, that's it.
