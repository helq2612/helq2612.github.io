My parters (Yifan and Dapeng) and I decided to build a website for E.Cafe at OSU. The website is: http://www.keccafe.com/.
The highlight points are:
1. It is a commercial-use dynamic website supporting user log in, food ordering and payment;
2. It is hosted on AWS EC2;
3. We use MongoDB database to store all the information;
4. This project lets our team to be more familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB/AJAX/AWS/MVC.
