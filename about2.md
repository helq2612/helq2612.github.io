  Hey there! I am Liqiang He, a CS graduate student in Oregon State University. 
</p>

Currently I am working in [Dr.Rebecca A. Hutchinson](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/hutchinson-rebecca)'s Machine Learning Group, dealing with Occupancy-Detection Model that takes into account class-conditional noise in classification problems. Our paper "Species Distribution Modeling of Citizen Science Data as a Classification Problem with Class-conditional Noise" was published on AAAI-17 in Feb. 2017

As a Master of Science student majored in Computer Science in Oregon State University, I have a significant background in machine learning and data science. Course highlights include: 

* CS534 Machine Learning
* CS519 Deep Learning
* CS536 Probabilistic Graphic Models
* CS540 Database Management Systems
* CS515 Algorithms & Data Structures
* CS575 Introduction to Parallel Programming
* CS496 Cloud and Mobile Development (Android)

Some of the course projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/helq2612).
